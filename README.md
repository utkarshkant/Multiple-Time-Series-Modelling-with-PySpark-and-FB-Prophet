# Multiple Time Series Modelling with PySpark and FB Prophet

Here we have the data on weekly sales of multiple stores. The objective is to create a time-series forecast of all store sales and train the model simultaneously.

We use PySpark for data partitioning and management and FBProphet for time series modelling.
